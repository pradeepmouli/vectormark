# Agent-Guided Drawing MCP Design

**Date:** 2026-07-10  
**Area:** `src/vectormark/mcp_server.py` plus new trace, plan, and session-state modules.

## Goal

Replace the logo-specific MCP surface with one drawing-oriented entry point.
`trace_drawing` either runs the existing one-shot automatic idealizer or creates
an interactive trace that an agent refines through versioned plans.

```text
trace_drawing(image, { refine: "auto", ... })
  -> one-shot idealized SVG + preview + diagnostics

trace_drawing(image, { refine: "interactive", ... })
  -> drawing_id + version v0 + trace paths + labeled region map

refine_drawing(plan)
  -> drawing_id + derived version + SVG + refinement report + preview
```

## Product boundary

Only `trace_drawing(refine="interactive")` is stateful and MCP-server-local. It retains the
immutable trace artifact plus the native `VectorRegion` roots for every retained
version. A root carries its optimizer ID, current/original geometry, fill,
z-order, raster evidence, stable `drawing_id`, and `source_regions` provenance.
`refine_drawing` accepts no image and reads the opaque `drawing_id` from the
plan. Auto calls do not allocate a drawing ID, retain state, or participate in
versioning.

Each drawing belongs to the originating FastMCP `Context.session`. A drawing ID
is cryptographically random, valid only within that session, and expires after
30 minutes of inactivity. A successful refinement refreshes its idle expiry.
Unknown, expired, or cross-session IDs return the structured error code
`DRAWING_NOT_FOUND`. The MVP never writes drawing state to disk and does not
provide a portable trace import/export format.

## Trace modes

`refine` is required and has exactly two values:

- `auto`: run the established automatic idealization pipeline once and return
  SVG, preview, and diagnostics. It replaces `idealize_logo` and
  `idealize_logo_data`.
- `interactive`: create the retained trace artifact described below. It is the
  only mode that returns `drawing_id` and may be followed by `refine_drawing`.

The shared image-reference, preprocess contract, and six trace options remain
unchanged. Automatic mode maps `max_colors`, `trace_level`,
`simplify_tolerance`, `curve_tolerance`, and `curve_type` to the current
idealizer; `min_region_size` supplies its absolute component-size floor. It does
not carry forward logo-only flattening or manual symmetry toggles.
`render_idealized_logo` is renamed `render_drawing` and accepts either result
shape.

## Interactive trace contract

Interactive `trace_drawing` uses the existing secure image resolver and preprocessor,
then retains both deterministic raw paths and a compact agent-facing root
forest. Raw paths are produced by palette segmentation, contour extraction, and
path fitting; roots use the one-shot pipeline's size filtering and soft-surface
merge so an agent does not need to reason about every palette fragment. It does
**not** run primitive recognition, symmetry detection, clone detection, or
optimizer passes.

The public path is named `trace_path`, not `raw_path`. The stored contour samples
are the raw pixel or coverage evidence; `trace_path` is a pre-simplified line and
Bézier representation of that evidence. It is deliberately free of semantic
interpretation while remaining compact enough for stable command IDs and agent
reasoning.

### Interactive trace options

```json
{
  "max_colors": 16,
  "min_region_size": 16,
  "min_region_fraction": 0.02,
  "trace_level": "pixel",
  "simplify_tolerance": 1.5,
  "curve_tolerance": 1.0,
  "curve_type": "quadratic"
}
```

- `max_colors` is the palette-quantization ceiling.
- `min_region_size` is the minimum retained connected-component pixel count.
- `min_region_fraction` is the relative-to-largest-region floor used when
  constructing the agent-facing root regions. The complete raw trace remains
  available on demand, but small fragments do not become editable roots by
  default.
- `trace_level` is `pixel` for binary quantized-mask contours or `subpixel` for
  anti-alias-aware coverage contours. The result reports each region's effective
  level because the coverage safety guard may fall back to `pixel`.
- `simplify_tolerance` controls contour simplification and straight-run detection.
- `curve_tolerance` bounds fitted Bézier error.
- `curve_type` is `quadratic` by default or `cubic` for intentionally complex
  contours. Quadratics are the default because they resist raster stair-stepping.

Input crop, resize, and alpha handling remain in the existing preprocess options.
There are no trace options for symmetry, primitive recognition, fill inference,
surface merging, flattening, or shadow removal.

The returned structured result contains compact root data plus artifact
references; it does not embed large SVG strings or raw command lists in the
trace response. `raw_trace` is the on-demand artifact for the underlying raw
paths and stable command IDs:

```json
{
  "drawing_id": "drw_<opaque>",
  "version": "v0",
  "trace": {
    "width": 1024,
    "height": 1024,
    "regions": [
    {
      "id": "r1",
      "source_regions": ["r1", "r7"],
      "geometry": { "type": "path", "d": "M…Z" },
      "fill": { "type": "linear_gradient" }
    }
    ]
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "svg": "drawing://drw_<opaque>/v0.svg",
    "preview": "drawing://drw_<opaque>/v0.png",
    "labeled_svg": "drawing://drw_<opaque>/v0.labels.svg",
    "raw_trace": "drawing://drw_<opaque>/v0.trace.json"
  },
  "report": { "targets": [{ "id": "r1", "source_regions": ["r1"], "geometry": "path", "z": 0 }] }
}
```

Root IDs are deterministic for one trace: the retained one-shot surfaces sort
by descending area, segment label, and color. Raw command IDs include a
subpath index so holes and disconnected contours remain unambiguous.

The default labeled SVG renders editable roots and their region IDs. The raw
trace artifact contains the exhaustive raw-path region map for command-level
planning when a root needs a custom path.

## Refinement-plan contract

`refine_drawing` accepts a single typed plan:

```json
{
  "version": "vectormark.plan.v1",
  "drawing_id": "drw_<opaque>",
  "base_version": "v0",
  "label": "optional user-facing description",
  "defaults": { "epsilon": 1.5, "max_error": 1.0 },
  "ops": []
}
```

The server validates the plan before mutation: the drawing exists for the
current session; the base version exists; every referenced region, group,
command, and fill is known;
operation IDs are unique; and path source commands form a directed contiguous
run within one raw subpath. Validation errors are returned as `INVALID_PLAN`
with a JSON pointer and actionable message.

`defaults.epsilon` and `defaults.max_error` override the retained trace
defaults for the plan. `set_geometry`, `detect_primitives`, and
`detect_symmetry` may each supply either field directly; an operation value
overrides the plan default. `epsilon` governs simplification/primitive fitting
and `max_error` bounds Bézier fitting. Both must be finite and non-negative.
Detection diagnostics are included with each returned target. In particular,
`detect_symmetry` returns its accepted axis there, so the next versioned plan
can use that axis directly in `set_symmetry`.

### Version tree

Every trace begins at immutable version `v0`. A successful plan creates a new
immutable child of its base version; it never overwrites its parent. Version IDs
are branch paths: the first, second, and third refinements of `v0` are `v0.0`,
`v0.1`, and `v0.2`; the first child of `v0.1` is `v0.1.0`. The server assigns the
next child segment atomically, so agents provide only `base_version` and cannot
collide when submitting alternatives concurrently.

Each version stores its parent version, accepted plan, immutable tuple of native
`VectorRegion` roots, and optional plan `label`. SVG, preview, labeled SVG, and
the target report are rendered on demand from those roots. There is no parallel
`DrawingScene` or `RenderTarget` tree. Agents can branch from any retained
version and present sibling alternatives without retracing the original raster.
Each operation is a pure transform that returns fresh affected `VectorRegion`
objects; the complete plan is atomically committed as one child drawing version.
No operation mutates the base version or creates a separately persisted partial
version.

### Scene operations

- `merge`: create a semantic target from regions, retain their combined
  source-region ancestry, and serialize their `SkPath` boolean union as one
  outline. This removes shared interior edges before SVG emission so adjacent
  same-fill regions cannot produce anti-aliased hairlines. Path-local `group`
  remains separate.
- `split`: invoke the existing compound-region splitter for the selected target.
  Its returned branch children are addressed in the next plan using the existing
  hyphenated convention (`r1-1`, `r1-2`).
- `detect_primitives`, `detect_symmetry`, and `detect_clones`: run the named
  existing automatic inference pass globally when `target` is omitted, or only
  for an explicitly supplied target. A targeted symmetry operation also permits
  a mirror-pair match involving that target. Clone detection includes
  translation, rotation, and reflected affine clones; accepted clones emit SVG
  `<use>` rather than a baked duplicate path.
- `set_symmetry`: apply an agent-supplied mirror relationship between `source`
  and `target` using an axis `{theta, cx, cy}` rather than infer one.
- `clone`: apply an agent-supplied source/target/transform relationship.
- `set_geometry`: assign a target to `circle`, `ellipse`, `rect`,
  `rounded_rect`, `polygon`, `trapezoid`, `rounded_trapezoid`, `cap`, or `path`.
- `set_fill`: assign `flat`, `linear_gradient`, `radial_gradient`, or `raster`.
- `set_z_order`: establish final paint order for all emitted targets.

`split` is structural and must be the final operation in a plan.
`detect_symmetry` is structural only when it needs to split a freeform
self-symmetric path. A global symmetry detection must be final; a terminal
block may contain several targeted `detect_symmetry` operations for distinct
regions. Inspect the returned report, then address any derived hyphenated
children in a new versioned plan. Explicitly selected intrinsically symmetric
geometry, such as a cap or rounded trapezoid, is retained as one region and
reported as `mode: "intrinsic"` rather than being split into a redundant pair.
Clone `<use>` relationships remain symbolic through interactive and one-shot
output unless explicit SVG flattening is requested. A self-symmetry mirror
`<use>` is the exception: it is baked to a concrete path immediately before
`simplify` or `seams`, so polish passes see both sides of a shared seam and
cannot leave an anti-aliased hairline.

Automatic one-shot refinement runs the existing optimizer pass sequence,
including occlusion, compound splitting, symmetry, clones, simplification, and
seams. Interactive tracing remains raw; interactive plans opt into automatic
behavior through the ordered `detect_*` scene operations.

### MVP path operations

For `set_geometry` with `type: "path"`, the geometry owns an ordered `ops`
array:

- `group`: trace-path commands -> named logical segment.
- `fit`: logical segment -> `line`, `quadratic`, `cubic`, or `keep`.
- `simplify` and `seams`: geometry-local cleanup operations.
- `break`: request a G0 discontinuity after a named segment.
- `close`: close the current subpath.

Adjacent fitted path segments are tangent-continuous by default; only `break`
requests a sharp join. A `fit` operation creates final SVG commands; agents do
not author final path coordinates.

## Execution model

The trace module produces an internal `DrawingState` and a public,
JSON-safe summary. The plan executor transforms only cached `VectorRegion`
roots, fits requested geometry to raw contour evidence, maps declared fills to
the existing fill classes, and runs named `detect_*` operations through the
existing optimizer passes. It does not mutate the stored trace. Each accepted
plan creates an immutable version, so the agent may issue multiple branches for
one drawing.

The refinement result includes its new version ID, artifact references, and
target-level geometry/fill/provenance summaries. Call
`get_drawing_artifact` to retrieve the SVG, clean PNG preview, or labeled SVG.

### Trace-engine boundary and native follow-up

The tracing implementation is VectorMark's own pipeline: palette segmentation,
`find_contours`, and custom line/Bézier fitting. It is not Potrace or vtracer.
The MCP MVP wraps it behind a `TraceEngine.trace(rgb, options) -> TraceResult`
boundary. The initial implementation uses the existing Python/scikit-image
pipeline; retained `DrawingState` ensures every branch refines a trace once
rather than retracing it.

Trace-engine substitution is a Phase 2 performance project, after profiling
representative MCP drawings. A Rust implementation or an adapter for a
third-party tracer may replace segmentation, contour extraction, and curve
fitting behind the same `TraceEngine` interface. Any replacement must preserve
the public trace result, command-ID rules, and trace-options semantics, so it
does not alter the MCP tools, drawing store, version tree, or plan schema.

## Non-goals

- CLI commands or a portable trace file.
- Ribbons, arcs, path congruency, and a general constraint solver.
- Persistence across an MCP server restart or session end.
- Retaining state for automatic calls.

## Testing and acceptance

Unit tests cover deterministic IDs, command parsing, session isolation, sliding
TTL, expiration, plan validation, primitive fitting, path operation execution,
fill emission, z-order, and no mutation of stored state. MCP integration tests
call both tools over stdio using a data URI.

Given a flat folded-ribbon-style raster, acceptance requires a labeled region
map, two sibling plans from `v0` with distinct labels, a child plan from one
sibling, native circles for equal dots, a flat or gradient fill, and no automatic
symmetry or candidate inference during tracing.
